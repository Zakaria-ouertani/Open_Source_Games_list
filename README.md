# Open source games
You will notice "tags" in front of each title like ***\[W\]*** or ***\[AL\]*** or ***\[ALW\]***.
Those are the platforms the game is compatible with be it "**official**" or through wine/proton which are like this:

|Letter	|	Platform					|
|-------|	----------------------- 	|
|**A**	|	<ins>**A**</ins>ndroid		|
|**B**	|	<ins>**B**</ins>rowser		|
|**IRL**|	<ins>**Real Life**</ins>	|
|**H**	|	<ins>**H**</ins>aiku		|
|**L**	|	<ins>**L**</ins>inux		|
|**M**	|	<ins>**M**</ins>ac			|
|**P**	|	<ins>**P**</ins>roton		|
|**S**	|	P<ins>**S**</ins>			|
|**N**	|	<ins>**N**</ins>intendo		|
|**W**	|	<ins>**W**</ins>indows		|
|**\***	|	Has many other ports		|
|**X**	|	Not fully open source		|

### Notes
- Games that run natively on linux won't have the <ins>**P**</ins>roton tag. (Though all open source games I found so far run natively on linux)
- Games with <ins>**P**</ins>roton support will have a link to ProtonDB so you can check it's compatibility.
